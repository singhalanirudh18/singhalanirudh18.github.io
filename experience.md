During my short professional journey, I got the opportunity to acquire diverse experience in research, product, and teaching. As a researcher, I started my journey by interning in Media and Data Science Research Lab, Adobe, followed by various <a href="/research">research projects</a>. I had the opportunity to work closely with a growing startup <a href="https://okcredit.in/">OkCredit</a> as a summer intern, which helped me get insights into India's entrepreneurship culture. During my time as a Teaching Assistant, I taught students from different disciplines.
