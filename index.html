<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>My name is Anirudh Singhal, and I'm currently an Associate in the Fixed Income Division of Morgan Stanley. I've completed a 5-year <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/dualdegree.jsp">Dual Degree</a> (Bachelor and Master of Technology) program in <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a>'s <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/">Electrical Engineering</a> department with a specialization in <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~comgroup/">Communication and Signal Processing</a>.
