My name is Anirudh Singhal, and I'm a final year undergraduate student at <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">IIT Bombay</a> pursuing a <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/dualdegree.jsp">Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech.)</a> in <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/">Electrical Engineering</a> with specialization in <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~comgroup/">Communication and Signal Processing</a> and a minor in <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/">Computer Science and Engineering</a>. My research interests includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">Machine Learning</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">Computer Vision</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20a%20Markov%20decision,control%20of%20a%20decision%20maker.">Markov Decision Processes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless">Wireless Communication</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit#:~:text=In%20probability%20theory%2C%20the%20multi,properties%20are%20only%20partially%20known">Multi-Armed Bandits</a>. Currently I'm working with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nikhilkaram/">Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani</a> on using Multi-Armed Bandits Algorithms to efficiently estimate the mode of a high-dimensional dataset with a underlying continous distribution using active sampling of dimensions.

In Autumn'19 I went for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_exchange_program">Semester Exchange</a> to <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english">Technical University of Denmark (DTU)</a> as I love to travel and challenge myself. During this period I backpacked across various countries in Central and Western Europe and met people from all around the world. You can see more about my travelling <a href="/miscellany/travel">here</a>.

I was also a member in <a href="https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/satlab/elecSS.php">Electrical Subsystem</a> of <a href="https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/satlab/index.php">IIT Bombay Student Satellite Project (IITBSSP)</a>. During this period I worked on the <a href="https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/satelliteWiki/index.php/Flight_Code">flight code</a> for the <a href="https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/satelliteWiki/index.php/On-Board_Computer_(OBC)">On-Board Computer</a>. I also actively contrubited to <a href="https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/satelliteWiki/index.php/Satellite_101">Satellite 101 Wiki</a>, part of IITBSSP's social initiative to spread information about satellite technology among students.
